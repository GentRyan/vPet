Virtual Pet Daemon
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Virtual Pet Daemon (VPD) is a daemon that simulates a virtual pet that you can interface with through user-creatable and customizable frontends. The daemon can also be theoretically run over a network, however this has not been tested.

Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Simply run the included install.sh script, which will automatically compile the binaries.

Compiling from source
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Simply use make on the included makefile. Please note that there is no 'make install' option as of now. You will also have to manually create your ~/vpd.txt file. The default file is included in this directory.

Use
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
First, start the daemon using ./vpd. Then, start the basic pet program using ./vpclient. After that, please refer to your frontends included documentation for controlling your pet. Note: vpd MUST be started first. Nothing else will run until that's started! If you are using the included Ruby Pet frontend, please see the README there for help.
